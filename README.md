| PersonName | Name of the recipient | "John Smith", "Jane Doe" |
| EmailsSent | Whether an email was sent | "yes", "no", 1, 0 |
| EmailsOpened | Whether the email was opened | "yes", "no", 1, 0 |
| EmailsClicked | Whether the email was clicked | "yes", "no", 1, 0 |

### 2. Loading Data

- **Upload CSV**: Click the "Browse files" button in the sidebar to upload your CSV data
- **Sample Data**: Alternatively, click "Load Sample Data" to explore the dashboard with demo data

### 3. Using the Dashboard

- **Filters**: Use the dropdown menus at the top to filter by company, job role, or metric type
- **Summary Metrics**: View key performance indicators at the top of the dashboard
- **Performance Analysis**: Toggle between bar charts and data tables to analyze your data
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Expand this section to see personalized insights based on your data
- **Advanced Analytics**: Explore correlation patterns and run future campaign simulations
- **Data Export**: Download your filtered data as a CSV file for further analysis

## üîç Understanding the Metrics

- **Open Rate**: Percentage of sent emails that were opened
- **Click Rate**: Percentage of sent emails that had at least one click
- **Click-to-Open Rate (CTOR)**: Percentage of opened emails that were clicked
- **Engagement Score**: A weighted metric combining open rate (40%) and click rate (60%)

## üíª For Developers

### Project Structure

The application is contained in a single Python file with the following components:

- **Page Configuration**: Sets up the Streamlit interface
- **Custom CSS**: Provides styling for the dashboard elements
- **Helper Functions**: Process data and calculate metrics
- **Data Loading**: Handles CSV upload and sample data creation
- **Data Processing**: Converts and calculates metrics from raw data
- **Visualization Components**: Creates charts and interactive elements
- **Insights Generation**: Produces recommendations based on the data
- **Advanced Analytics**: Creates correlation charts and simulations

### Key Functions

- `convert_binary_data(df)`: Converts yes/no values to 1/0 for metrics columns
- `calculate_metrics(df)`: Calculates open rates, click rates, and engagement scores
- `generate_industry_benchmarks()`: Provides comparison benchmarks
- `create_sample_data()`: Generates demo data for the dashboard

### Customization Options

#### Adding New Metrics

To add a new metric, modify the `calculate_metrics()` function:

```python
def calculate_metrics(df):
    # Existing code...
    
    # Add your new metric calculation
    result_df['NewMetric'] = np.where(condition,
                                     calculation_if_true,
                                     calculation_if_false)
    
    return result_df
```

#### Modifying the UI

The dashboard uses Streamlit components and custom CSS. To modify the UI:

1. Update the CSS in the `st.markdown("""<style>...""")` section
2. Modify the layout using Streamlit's column system: `col1, col2 = st.columns(2)`
3. Add new visualization sections using tabs: `tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Tab1", "Tab2"])`

#### Adding New Visualizations

To add a new chart:

```python
# Create a new figure
fig = go.Figure(go.Bar(
    x=data['x_values'],
    y=data['y_values'],
    text=[f"{val:.1f}%" for val in data['y_values']],
    textposition='outside',
    marker_color='rgba(74, 111, 255, 0.7)'
))

# Configure layout
fig.update_layout(
    title='Chart Title',
    xaxis_title='X-Axis Label',
    yaxis_title='Y-Axis Label',
    height=400
)

# Display the chart
st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **CSV Format Errors**: Ensure your CSV has all required columns with correct names
- **Data Type Errors**: The application will try to convert text values like "yes"/"no" to binary, but consistent formatting is recommended
- **Empty Charts**: Check if your filters have removed all relevant data points
- **Performance Issues**: For very large datasets, consider pre-aggregating your data
